1.	Refactor all classes, most importantly:
	- Tetris
	- GamePanel

	These two classes fell by the wayside during development as focus was
	on the game logic.  They are admittedly abominations.

2.	Add/Edit comments for better coherency.

//3.	Add levels (this goes hand-in-hand with refactoring somewhat as the
//	current construct does not allow for consolidated start/stop and
//	event management. #learning java.

4.      Refactoring still needs to happen...  I feel like I've been too weary
        after work and that I am failing to understand how to structurally
        reorganize this mess.

5.      Clean up all classes
        -  Group all public/private functions
