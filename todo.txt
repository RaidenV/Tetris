1.	Refactor all classes, most importantly:
	- Tetris
	- GamePanel

	These two classes fell by the wayside during development as focus was
	on the game logic.  They are admittedly abominations.

2.	Add/Edit comments for better coherency.

3.	Add levels (this goes hand-in-hand with refactoring somewhat as the
	current construct does not allow for consolidated start/stop and
	event management. #learning java.
